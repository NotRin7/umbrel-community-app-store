  located at /home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/notrin-litecoin/docker-compose.yml,

  by replacing ip_of_umbrel_server with the actual IP address of your Umbrel server.

  After making this change, you will need to restart the Litecoin node for the changes to take effect.




  Run your Litecoin node to independently store and validate every Litecoin transaction with an easy-to-use graphical interface.
