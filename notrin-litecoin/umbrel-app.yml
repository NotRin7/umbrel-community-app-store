tagline: Run your personal node powered by Litecoin Core
description: >-
  Run your Litecoin node and independently store and validate
every single Litecoin transaction with it. Achieve unparalleled
privacy by connecting your wallet directly to your node to
ensure that your wallet company can’t spy on your transactions,
or worse — lie to you.


  Plus, transacting with your own node also helps keep the entire
  Litecoin network decentralized; win-win!


  Take control of your node and customize it to your needs. Control how your node connects to
  other nodes, adjust your daily upload limit, set the maximum mempool size, fine-tune its performance,
  and much more.


  Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.
